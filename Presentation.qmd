## Welcome!

::: {.important style="float: left; width: 65%;"}
**Goals:**

-   Describe reproducible workflows

-   Implement a reproducible workflow with Git/GitHub and Quarto

Ideally, use RStudio with git installed on the computer. Completely web-based alternatives discussed!

## Get to Know Each Other

- In the downtime, say hello to the people next to you!

## Fatherly Advice: Git/GitHub

If she'd just used Git/GitHub to track her recipes, we wouldn't be in this mess!

-   Git: keeps all recipe versions without this -->

## Git: Version Control Software

- You associate git with a folder (repo)

    -   Git keeps track of all files in the folder (repo)
    -   If you want to keep changes you've made, you **commit** the changes
    
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git_tracking.png")
```
    
## Git & GitHub

-   **Git** is a version control software

-   **Github** is an online hosting service for Git-based projects

    -   Very useful for collaborating and sharing work!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github.png")
```


## Mixing Cuisines!

Issue: Louisa keeps getting her Chinese food recipes mixed up with her Italian recipes!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Louisa_work_2.jpg")
```


## Fatherly Advice: R Projects

If only she'd use R projects!

## Fatherly Advice: R Projects

If only she'd use R projects!

::: {.important style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
- Basically a file that gets associated with a folder (repo)

- Maintains a working directory, history, environment, etc.

- Easy to switch between projects!

## R Projects

R projects provide a straightforward way to divide your work into multiple contexts. Each with their own:

-   Working directory
-   Workspace (environment with stored data/objects)
-   History
-   Folder structure & source documents

> -   Can be used outside of git/github
> - Spyder IDE for python has similar functionality

## Including Thoughts/Comments

Lousia has trouble remembering what she was thinking when trying her recipes! 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Louisa_work.jpg")
```


## Fatherly Advice: Quarto

If only she'd use Quarto (or, alternatively, Jupyter) Notebooks!


## Fatherly Advice: Quarto

If only she'd use Quarto (or, alternatively, Jupyter) Notebooks!

::: {.important style="float: left; width: 50%;"}
-   Give us a way to include thoughts and comments with nice formatting
- Can output to HTML, PDF, Word, Power Point, ...
- Code can be included and output automatically embedded!

## Quarto

Designed to be used in three ways ([R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto))

-   Communicating to decision makers (focus on conclusions not code)

-   Collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!)

-   As environment to do data science (documents what you did and what you were thinking)


## Sharing Recipes

Louisa wants to share her delicious recipes with her friends! 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Louisa_Cora.jpg")
```

## Fatherly Advice: Use Quarto & Github

If only she'd use Quarto with GitHub!


## Fatherly Advice: Use Quarto & Github

If only she'd use Quarto with GitHub!

-   Easy way to **collaborate** and share **results** 

- Can simply store code on git/github or include output from quarto

- Quarto can easily(-ish) create a webpage on github!


## List of Tools

- Git: Version control software
- GitHub: Online platform for using git/collaborating
- R Project: Keep analysis in its own context
- Quarto: Integrate text and code to create useful output docs

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - web based way to program in python and R 

    - Can use with github
    - Some functionality similar to quarto
    

## Data Science Workflow

Usually

-   Read in raw data and manipulate it
-   Combine data sources
-   Summarize data to glean insights
-   Apply common analysis methods
-   Communicate Effectively

> Want to document this process and make it reproducible, collaborative, and easily shared!


## Practice!

- Sign up for github account
- Create a repo
- Make some changes! Check version control

## Recap

Reproducibility means:

- Entire analysis can be redone from start to finish

    - Git enables us to do version control
    - GitHub enables us to collaborate and share

- Code should be documented with thought process

    - Quarto or Jupyter Notebooks allow for interweaving of text and code
    
- R projects are great for separating analyses
